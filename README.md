## Description
This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using Spring Boot for the backend and next.js with TypeScript for the frontend. The application allows users to browse products, add them to the shopping cart, ...

---

## Notes and Assumptions
- I have made dnd effect for categories only and not products
- after reordering categories in the admin/categories page, there is a button at bottom, it must be clicked for the new order to be persited in the database
- I just made a basic cart with certain API calls to the backend

## application architecture:

ðŸ’¡ **TODO:** 
- [ ] add application architecture schema diagram


### high level explanation:
This is a simplified ecommerce project with features like fetching categories, products, managing them in admin panel, implementing drag-and-drop functionality for easy management of the categories and products.

### Backend architecture:
- technologies:
  - spring boot
  - postgreSQL
  - JWT authentication
 

- drag-and-drop: was implemented by persisting the data in the database to enable the user to get access to the new listing order customized by the admin. the frontend data used to achieve this were the id and listingOrder of the categories, where the order hierarchy inducted through the index order of the categories after/during the dragging, where the exposed hooks and props of dnd-kit were being used to track the new order of the categories and to track the dragged and target item. these data were used to fetch the categories from the database and persist them with the updated hierarchy order.

- API structure:
- categories:
  - api/categories
    ---> categories in order
  - api/categories//update-categories-order
    ---> reorder categories
- products:
  - api/products
    ---> products in order
- cart:
  - api/cart/get-carts
    ---> get user cart along with the cart items
  - api/cart/add-cart-item
    ---> add a cart item to the user cart
- cart item:
  - api/cart-item/increment-cart-item/{id}
    ---> increment quantity of a cartitem of the user cart
- api/auth/register
  ---> register/sign up
- api/auth/authenticate
 ---> login/sign in

### frontend architecture:
- app routes:
  - user routes:
    - categories
    - categories/[categoryName]
    - categories/[categoryName]/product
  - admin routes:
    - categories
    - categories/[categoryName]
- components:
  -  are inside 'components' directory
  -  some component: Category, Product, AdminCategory, Authentication, AuthProvider , Cart , CartProduct, CartOrderSummary
- redux slices are inside 'redux' directory
  -  some redux slices: auth, cart, category, ...
- dnd-kit components are inside 'components/admin/dnd'
  - Draggable
  - Droppable
  - DnDContext
  - onDragOver event handler, active and over props
- data fetching:
  - axios
  - NEXTjs API routing
  - api.ts

## Installation (local development)


### Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- Git


### Backend Setup
- clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ali8137/ecommerce-exam.git
cd ecommerce-exam
```

- configure environment variables:


backend environment variables: JWT_SECRET_KEY, MYSQL_DB_USERNAME, and MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD
frontend environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL, and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL

it is recommended to add .env file at the root of each project side

- install dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

or using "ctrl + shift + o" in Intellij IDEA

- run the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```


### Database Setup
- create the database:

```bash
postgre -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;"
```

or using pgadmi4 UI

don't forget to create the database in postgreSQL 'ecommerce-exam'
there are initdb SQL files in the backend part, execute them before starting the project for better devlopment experience

---

## Usage
- once the backend is running, you can access the app at http://localhost:8080 and the frontend at http://localhost:3000

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/...` - ...
- `POST /api/...` - ...
- `PUT /api/...` - ...
- 

### Authentication
To access protected routes, you need to authenticate using a JWT token. 
- Log in using `POST /api/auth/register` with your email and password.
- After successful login, use the returned JWT token in the `Authorization` header of your subsequent requests.

### Example Request
request: 
**POST** `http://localhost:8088/api/login`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

response:
{
  "accessToken": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
